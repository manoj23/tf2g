tf2g
====

A tool for converting Mozilla Thunderbird filters into Gmail filters

For the moment, it only understands the *move* action from the Thunderbird filter.
If the condition *junk status* is used, tf2g will ignore it.

TODO
====
* Some action/condition may not be supported
* Handle non-ASCII characters
* It remains one FIXME
